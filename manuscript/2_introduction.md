# Introduction

Left-right (LR) asymmetry is often integrated into the basic body plan in bilaterians.
For example, internal organs of bilaterians are often LR asymmetric in their morphology and functions.
The mechanisms of LR asymmetric development have been well studied in vertebrates[@Blum2018; @Hirokawa2006; @Nakamura2012; @Levin2005; @Yoshiba2014].
For example, in mice, motile cilia locating in the node rotates clockwise and induces a leftward flow of extra-embryonic fluid, which first breaks the LR symmetry[@Nonaka1998].
This phenomenon is called as "nodal flow" that subsequently induces the left-side-specific expression of genes, such as *Nodal* and *Lefty*, required for the LR asymmetric development of organs[@Nonaka2002; @Nonaka1998; @Takeda1999].
The mechanisms of the LR symmetry breaking are evolutionarily diverged even among vertebrates.
For example, in reptile and chick, the nodal flow-independent mechanisms of the LR-symmetry breaking were reported[@Kajikawa2020; @Tabin2005].
In invertebrates, the chirality of cells (cell chirality) contributes to their LR-asymmetric development[@Inaki2016; @Inaki2018a].
An object, such as a cell, is chiral if it cannot be superimposed onto its mirror image.
In snails and nematodes, the cell chirality of blastomeres at the initial stage of cleavage determines the subsequent LR-asymmetric arrangement of them, which consequently directs the LR asymmetry of their whole bodies[@Kuroda2009; @Naganathan2014].

*Drosophila* has various organs showing stereotypic LR asymmetry, which include, for example, the embryonic gut, male genitalia, and brain[@Hayashi2001; @Hozumi2006; @Ligoxygakis2001; @Pascual2004; @Speder2006; @Maeda2007; @Nakamura2013; @Taniguchi2007; @Kuroda2012].
The embryonic hindgut is the first organ that shows LR asymmetry during the development of this species[@Hayashi2001].
The hindgut is formed in LR-asymmetric structure whose anterior part curves toward the ventral side of the embryo and subsequently rotates counterclockwise $90^\circ$, which makes it bent rightward[@Hozumi2006].
It was shown that the active force for driving the hindgut rotation is generated by the hindgut epithelial tube[@Hozumi2008; @Inaki2018].
Before the rotation, apical cell-boundaries of the hindgut epithelial cells slant leftward with respect to the anterior-posterior axis of this organ[@Taniguchi2011; @Hatori2014; @Ishibashi2019; @Inaki2018].
Considering the apical-basal polarity of the hindgut epithelial cells, the three-dimensional structure of them has cell chirality[@Taniguchi2011].
During the rotation, the cell chirality eventually dissolved so that the cell shape becomes bilaterally symmetric after the rotation of the hindgut[@Taniguchi2011].
Cooperative studies between computer simulations involving vertex models and image analysis of the hindgut epitheelium suggested that the dissolution of the cell chirality induces "cell sliding," which leads to the LR-asymmetric rotation of the hindgut epithelial tube[@Taniguchi2011; @Inaki2018].
Contributions of cell chirality to the LR-asymmetric development were reported in other LR asymmetric organs in *Drosophila*, suggesting that cell chirality has general roles in the LR-asymmetric development of this species[@Sato2015; @Speder2006; @Coutelis2013; @Gonzalez-Morales2015].
Not only in snails, nematodes, and *Drosophila* but also in Chordata, such as chicken and Larvaceans, the cell chirality was observed and suggested to be involved in the LR asymmetric development of these species[@Ray2018; @Onuma2020].
In addition to the cell chirality observed *in vivo* during development, various cultured cells from *Dictyostelium* to humans demonstrate intrinsic chirality in their structure and movement[@Chen2012; @Tamada2010; @Tee2015; @Wan2011; @Xu2007].
Thus cell chirality is a widely observed property shared among eukaryotic cells.

Using *Drosophila* as a model system, genetic mechanisms underlying the formation of cell chirality has been studied[@Ishibashi2019; @Taniguchi2011; @Gonzalez-Morales2015].
*MyosinID* (*MyoID*), a Myosin I family gene and also called *Myosin31DF*, has an activity to induce dextral cell chirality, so that the loss-of-function mutations of *MyoID* resulted in the sinistral cell chirality and the LR-inversion of various organs demonstrating dextral LR asymmetry in wild-type, including the embryonic hindgut[@Hatori2014; @Inaki2018; @Ishibashi2019; @Sato2015; @Speder2006; @Taniguchi2011; @Gonzalez-Morales2015; @Lebreton2018].
*MyosinIC* (*MyoIC*), also called *Myosin61F* and belonging to Myosin I family, bears an activity to induce sinistral cell chirality, which leads to the LR inversion of various organs with handedness upon its overexpression[@Hozumi2006; @Hozumi2008; @Okumura2015; @Lebreton2018].
Besides these Myosin I family genes, we previously found that the loss-of-function mutations of *extra macrochaetae* (*emc*) gene, the *Drosophila* ortholog of *Id*, shows the randomization of the hindgut handedness[@Ishibashi2019].
*Id* encodes a class V helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein that inhibits E-box protein, a class of basic HLH transcriptional factor such as Daughterless (Da) in *Drosophila*, by forming heterodimer, which regulates the balance between cell differentiation and cell proliferation[@Wang2015a].
We found the *MyoID* functions downstream of or parallel to *emc* in the cell chirality formation[@Ishibashi2019].
However, although genetic mechanisms of cell chirality formation began to be understood, the causal relationship between the cell chirality and hindgut rotation was predicted only on apparent concordance between the enantiomorphic states of cell chirality and the directions of the hindgut rotation in various mutants and on the results of computer simulation recapitulating the rotation of the model gut tube driven by the dissolution of cell chirality[@Taniguchi2011; @Inaki2018].
Therefore, the validity of such cause and effect relationship was still needed.

Here, we mathematically evaluated the causal relationship between the cell chirality and hindgut rotation.
We developed a new live-imaging procedure to analyze the cell chirality and subsequent rotation of the hindgut, which provide an opportunity to test the cause and effect relationship between them.
Our study validated that the enantiomorphic states of cell chirality causally defines the LR asymmetry of the hindgut rotation.
