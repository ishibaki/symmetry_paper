# Introduction

Left-right (LR) asymmetry is often integrated into the basic body plan in bilaterians.
For example, internal organs of bilaterians are often LR asymmetric in their morphology.
The mechanisms of LR asymmetric development have been well studied in vertebrates [@Blum2018; @Hirokawa2006; @Nakamura2012; @Levin2005; @Yoshiba2014].
For example, in mice, motile cilia locating in the node rotates clockwise and induces a leftward flow of extra-embryonic fluid, which first breaks the LR symmetry [@Nonaka1998].
This phenomenon is called as "nodal flow" that subsequently induces the left-side-specific expression of genes, such as *Nodal* and *Lefty*, required for the LR asymmetric development [@Nonaka2002; @Nonaka1998; @Takeda1999].
The mechanism of the LR symmetry breaking has evolutionarily diverged.
For example, in reptile and chick, the nodal flow-independent mechanism of the LR-symmetry breaking were reported [@Kajikawa2020; @Tabin2005] [Tabinの引用あってますか?]{.comment-start author="Tomoki Ishibashi"

In invertebrates, the chirality of cells (cell chirality) contributes to their LR asymmetric development [@Inaki2016; @Inaki2018a].
For example, in snails and nematodes, the chirality of blastomeres at the initial stage determine the subsequent LR asymmetric arrangement of them, which consequently directs the LR asymmetry of their whole bodies [@Kuroda2009; @Naganathan2014].

*Drosophila* has various organs showing stereotypic LR asymmetry, including, for example, the embryonic gut, male genitalia, brain [@Hayashi2001; @Hozumi2006; @Ligoxygakis2001; @Pascual2004; @Speder2006].
The embryonic hindgut is the first organ that shows LR asymmetry during the development of this species [@Hayashi2001].
The hindgut is formed in LR asymmetric structure whose anterior part curves toward the ventral side of the embryo and subsequently rotates counterclockwise $90^\circ$, which makes it bent rightward [@Hozumi2006].
It was shown that the active force for driving the hindgut rotation is generated by the hindgut epithelial tube [@Hozumi2008; @Inaki2018].
Before the rotation, apical cell-boundaries of the hindgut epithelial cells slant leftward with respect to the anterior-posterior axis of this organ [@Taniguchi2011; @Hatori2014; @Ishibashi2019; @Inaki2018].
Considering the apical-basal polarity of the hindgut epithelial cells, the three-dimensional structure of these cells has chirality, designated as "cell chirality" [@Inaki2016; @Inaki2018a].
During the rotation, the cell chirality eventually dissolved so that the cell shape becomes symmetrically after the rotation of the hindgut [@Taniguchi2011].
Cooperative studies between computer simulations and image analysis revealed that the dissolution of the cell chirality induces "cell sliding," which leads to the LR asymmetric rotation of the hindgut epithelial tube [@Taniguchi2011; @Inaki2018].
Contributions of cell chirality were reported in other LR asymmetric organs of *Drosophila*, suggesting that cell chirality plays general roles in the LR asymmetric development in this species [@Sato2015; @Speder2006; @Coutelis2013; @Gonzalez-Morales2015].

Not only in *Drosophila*, also in other organisms, the cell chirality can be observed and it is involved in the LR asymmetric development.
In *Lymnaea* and *Caenorhabditis*, the cell shape of the blastomere is chiral, which associates with the subsequent LR asymmetric development [@Kuroda2009; @Shibazaki2004; @Wood1991; @Bergmann2003].
Recently, it has been reported that the cell chirality underlies the formation of the LR asymmetry in Chordata, chicken and Larvaceans [@Ray2018; @Onuma2020].
Thus, the cell chirality is a widely conserved property of cells, and it was supposed that the cell chirality regulates LR asymmetric development generally.

We have previously revealed the genetic mechanism regulating the cell chirality formation by using *Drosophila* as a model system [@Ishibashi2019; @Taniguchi2011].
The regulatory network composed of E and Id and the actomyosin system including MyoID and MyoIC are involved in the cell chirality [@Ishibashi2019; @Okumura2015; @Hozumi2008].
*Id* encodes class V HLH protein that inhibits E-box protein, bHLH transcriptional factor, by forming heterodimer, which regulates cell differentiation-proliferation balance [@Wang2015a].
In *Drosophila* embryos, the mutants of *extra macrochaetae* (*emc*), *Drosophila* an orthologous gene of *Id*, showed the randomization of LR laterality in the hindgut and the cell chirality [@Ishibashi2019].
Furthermore, *Myosin31DF* (*Myo31DF*), the orthologue of *MyoID*, is also involved in the cell chirality formation and the normal LR asymmetric development of the hindgut and the genital disk [@Ishibashi2019; @Inaki2018; @Hatori2014; @Taniguchi2011; @Sato2015; @Speder2006].
Despite the existence of the evidence that the cell chirality tightly couples with the LR asymmetry at the macroscopic scale, there are no reports that cell chirality is required for the LR asymmetric development.

Here, we mathematically analysed which the cell chirality regulates the LR asymmetric morphological development of the hindgut in *Drosophila*.
Furthermore, we performed live-imaging of the embryonic hindgut with the randomized cell chirality to confirm the disturbance of the cell chirality induces the LR asymmetric defects in the hindgut.
Our study first proved that the cell chirality is required for the LR asymmetric development of the organ.

Recently, the existence of the LR asymmetric property has been reported not only in the organ morphology but also at the cellular level [@Chen2012; @Tamada2010; @Tee2015; @Wan2011; @Xu2007].
Many mammalian cell lines seeded on a micropattern tilt unidirectionally and change the cellular shape to be LR asymmetric (refs).
Considering that the cells have apico-basal polarity, the 3D structure of the LR asymmetric cells cannot be superimposed onto their mirror image.
Thus, these LR asymmetric shape of the cells is named as "cell chirality".
