# Introduction

Left-right (LR) asymmetry is the basic body plan in bilaterians.
It has been widely known that internal organs of bilaterians are often LR asymmetric in morphology.
The mechanisms of LR asymmetric development have been well studied in vertebrates [@Blum2018; @Hirokawa2006; @Nakamura2012; @Levin2005; @Yoshiba2014].
For example, in mice, motile cilia locating in the node rotates clockwise and induces a leftward flow of extra-embryonic fluid, which first breaks the LR symmetry [@Nonaka1998].
This phenomenon is called as "nodal flow" and it has been reported that the nodal flow induces left-side-specific gene expressions required for the LR asymmetric development [@Nonaka2002; @Nonaka1998; @Okada1999].
In different classes from Mammalia, Nodal-independent mechanims for the LR-asymmetric organ morphogenesis were also reported.
In chicks or fish, it was found that the LR asymmetric looping of the heart develops by organ-intrinsic mechanism, which indicates that this morphogenesis was not caused by LR asymmetric gene expression (refs).

Recently, existence of the LR asymmetric property has been reported not only in the organ morphology but also at the cellular level [@Chen2012; @Wan2011; @Xu2007; @Tamada2010; @Tee2015].
Many mammalian cell lines seeded on a micropattern tilt unidirectionally and change the cellular shape to be LR asymmetric (refs).
Considering that the cells have apico-basal polarity, the 3D structure of the LR asymmetric cells cannot be superimposed onto their mirror image.
Thus, these LR asymmetric shape of the cells is named as "cell chirality".

From various *in vivo* researches, it has been implicated that the cell chirality is required for the LR asymmetric development of organs.
*In vivo* cell chirality was first discovered in the *Drosophila* embryonic hindgut [@Taniguchi2011].
The hindgut is the organ which first shows LR asymmetry by rotating $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise as viewed from the posterior ([@fig:fig1] A) [@Hozumi2006].
It has been shown that the hindgut itself generates the LR asymmetric rotational force, because the explanted wild-type hindgut normally rotated *in vitro* [@Inaki2018].
In the wild-type, before the directional rotation begins, the stereotypic cell chirality was observed in the apical surface of the hindgut epithelial cells with respect to the anterior-posterior axis of the hindgut [@Taniguchi2011; @Hatori2014; @Ishibashi2019; @Inaki2018].
During the rotation, the cell chirality eventually disappears and the cell shape becomes symmetrically after the rotation of the hindgut [@Taniguchi2011].
Previously, a computer simulation showed that the dissolution of the cell chirality is sufficient to lead the LR asymmetric rotation of a virtual hindgut [@Taniguchi2011].
It has also been reported that the cell chirality induces the LR asymmetric cellular movement, named as "cell sliding", and it involves in the LR asymmetric development of the hindgut [@Inaki2018].
Not only in *Drosophila*, also in other organisms, the cell chirality can be observed and it is involved in the LR asymmetric development.
In *Lymnaea* and *Caenorhabditis*, the cell shape of the blastomere is chiral, which associates with the subsequent LR asymmetric development [@Kuroda2009; @Shibazaki2004; @Wood1991; @Bergmann2003].
Recently, it has been reported that the cell chirality underlies the formation of the LR asymmetry in Chordata, chicken and Larvaceans [@Ray2018; @Onuma2020].
Thus, the cell chirality is widely conserved property of cells, and it was supposed that the cell chirality regulates LR asymmetric development generally.

We have previously revealed the genetic mechanism regulating the cell chirality formation by using *Drosophila* as a model system [@Ishibashi2019; @Taniguchi2011].
The regulatory network composed of E and Id and the actomyosin system including MyoID and MyoIC are involved in the cell chirality [@Ishibashi2019; @Okumura2015; @Hozumi2008].
*Id* encodes class V HLH protein that inhibits E-box protein, bHLH transciptional factor, by forming heterodimer, which regulates cell differentiation-proliferation balance [@Wang2015a].
In *Drosophila* embryos, the mutants of *extra macrochaetae* (*emc*), *Drosophila* orthologous gene of *Id*, showed the randomization of LR laterality in the hindgut and the cell chirality [@Ishibashi2019].
Furthermore, *Myosin31DF* (*Myo31DF*), orthologue of *MyoID*, is also involved in the cell chirality formation and the normal LR asymmetric development of the hindgut and the genital disk [@Ishibashi2019; @Inaki2018; @Hatori2014; @Taniguchi2011; @Sato2015; @Speder2006].
Despite the existence of the evidences that the cell chirality tightly coulples with the LR asymmetry at the macroscopic scale, there are no report that cell chirality is required for the LR asymmetric development.

Here, we mathematically analysed which the cell chirality regulates the LR asymmetric morphological development of the hindgut in *Drosophila*.
Furthermore, we performed live-imaging of the embryonic hindgut with the randomized cell chirality to confirm the disturbation of the cell chirality induces the LR asymmetric defects in the hingut.
Our study first proved that the cell chirality is required for the LR asymmetric development of the organ.
