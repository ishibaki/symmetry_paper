# Introduction

Left-right (LR) asymmetry is often integrated into the basic body plan in bilaterians.
For example, internal organs of bilaterians are often LR asymmetric in their morphology.
The mechanisms of LR asymmetric development have been well studied in vertebrates [@Blum2018; @Hirokawa2006; @Nakamura2012; @Levin2005; @Yoshiba2014].
For example, in mice, motile cilia locating in the node rotates clockwise and induces a leftward flow of extra-embryonic fluid, which first breaks the LR symmetry [@Nonaka1998].
This phenomenon is called as "nodal flow" that subsequently induces the left-side-specific expression of genes, such as *Nodal* and *Lefty*, required for the LR asymmetric development [@Nonaka2002; @Nonaka1998; @Takeda1999].
The mechanism of the LR symmetry breaking has evolutionarily diverged.
For example, in reptile and chick, the nodal flow-independent mechanism of the LR-symmetry breaking were reported [@Kajikawa2020; @Tabin2005] [Tabinの引用あってますか?]{.comment-start author="Tomoki Ishibashi"

In invertebrates, the chirality of cells (cell chirality) contributes to their LR asymmetric development [@Inaki2016; @Inaki2018a].
For example, in snails and nematodes, the chirality of blastomeres at the initial stage determine the subsequent LR asymmetric arrangement of them, which consequently directs the LR asymmetry of their whole bodies [@Kuroda2009; @Naganathan2014].

*Drosophila* has various organs showing stereotypic LR asymmetry, including, for example, the embryonic gut, male genitalia, brain [@Hayashi2001; @Hozumi2006; @Ligoxygakis2001; @Pascual2004; @Speder2006].
The embryonic hindgut is the first organ that shows LR asymmetry during the development of this species [@Hayashi2001].
The hindgut is formed in LR asymmetric structure whose anterior part curves toward the ventral side of the embryo and subsequently rotates counterclockwise $90^\circ$, which makes it bent rightward [@Hozumi2006].
It was shown that the active force for driving the hindgut rotation is generated by the hindgut epithelial tube [@Hozumi2008; @Inaki2018].
Before the rotation, apical cell-boundaries of the hindgut epithelial cells slant leftward with respect to the anterior-posterior axis of this organ [@Taniguchi2011; @Hatori2014; @Ishibashi2019; @Inaki2018].
Considering the apical-basal polarity of the hindgut epithelial cells, the three-dimensional structure of these cells has chirality, designated as "cell chirality" [@Inaki2016; @Inaki2018a].
During the rotation, the cell chirality eventually dissolved so that the cell shape becomes symmetrically after the rotation of the hindgut [@Taniguchi2011].
Cooperative studies between computer simulations and image analysis revealed that the dissolution of the cell chirality induces "cell sliding," which leads to the LR asymmetric rotation of the hindgut epithelial tube [@Taniguchi2011; @Inaki2018].
Contributions of cell chirality were reported in other LR asymmetric organs of *Drosophila*, suggesting that cell chirality plays general roles in the LR asymmetric development in this species [@Sato2015; @Speder2006; @Coutelis2013; @Gonzalez-Morales2015].
Not only in snails, nematodes, and *Drosophila*, but also in Chordata, such as chicken and Larvaceans, the cell chirality was observed and suggested to be involved in the LR asymmetric development of these species [@Ray2018; @Onuma2020].
In addition to the cell chirality observed *in vivo* during development, various cultured cells from *Dictyostelium* to human demonstrate intrinsic chirality in their structure and movement [@Chen2012; @Tamada2010; @Tee2015; @Wan2011; @Xu2007].
Thus cell chirality is widely observed property of eukaryotic cells.

Using *Drosophila* as a model system, genetic mechanisms underlying the formation of cell chirality has been studied [@Ishibashi2019; @Taniguchi2011; @Gonzalez-Morales2015].
*MyosinID* (*MyoID*), a Myosin I family gene and also called *Myosin31DF*, has an activity to induce dextral cell chirality, so that the loss-of-function mutations of *MyoID* resulted in the sinistral cell chirality and the LR-inversion of various organs demonstrating LR asymmetry, including the embryonic hindgut [@Hatori2014; @Inaki2018; @Ishibashi2019; @Sato2015; @Speder2006; @Taniguchi2011; @Gonzalez-Morales2015].
*MyosinIC* (*MyoIC*), also called *Myosin61F* and belonging to Myosin I family, bears an activity to induce sinistral cell chirality, which leads to the LR inversion of various organs with handedness upon its overexpression [@Hozumi2006; @Hozumi2008; @Okumura2015].
Besides these Myosin I family genes, we previously found that the loss-of function mutations of *extra macrochaetae* (*emc*) gene, the *Drosophila* ortholog of *Id*, shows the randomization of the hindgut handedness [@Ishibashi2019].
*Id* encodes class V HLH protein that inhibits E-box protein, a class of bHLH transcriptional factor such as Daughterless (Da) in *Drosophila*, by forming heterodimer, which regulates cell differentiation-proliferation balance [@Wang2015a].
We found the *MyoID* functions downstream of or parallel to *emc* in the cell chirality formation.
However, although genetic mechanisms of cell chirality formation began to be understood, the causal relationship between the cell chirality and hindgut rotation was predicted only on apparent concordance between the states of cell chirality and the direction of the hindgut rotation in various mutants and on the results of computer simulation recapitulating the rotation of the model gut tube driven by the dissolution of cell chirality [@Taniguchi2011; @Inaki2018].
Therefore, the validity of such cause and effect relationship has not been addressed.

Here, we mathematically evaluated the causal relationship between the cell chirality and hindgut rotation.
We developed a new live-imaging procedure to analyze the cell chirality and subsequent rotation of the hindgut, which provide an opportunity to test the cause and effect relationship between them.
Our study validated that the enantiomorphic states of cell chirality causally defines the LR asymmetry of the hindgut rotation.
