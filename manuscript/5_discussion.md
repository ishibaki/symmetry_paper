# Discussion

In this paper, we demonstrated that the cell chirality is essential for the determination of LR asymmetry of the hindgut ([@fig:fig2]; [@fig:fig3]).
First, we showed the LR asymmetry of the hindgut tightly couples with the cell chirality ([@fig:fig2]B).
Our generalized linear model with the chirality index as an explanatory variable significantly fit to our data ([@fig:fig2]B).
This result means that the laterality of the hingut was statistically explained even only by the cell chirality.
Next, We found that the live cell chirality also couples with the LR asymmetry of the hingut ([@fig:fig3]C).
We used *emc* mutants to "disturb" the cell chirality formation and examined which the abnormally formed cell chirality induces the defects in the LR asymmetry of the hindgut.
Previously, we showed that the cell chirality is sufficient for the LR asymmetric development in *Drosophila* embryonic hindgut [@Taniguchi2011; @Inaki2018].
Here, we ascertained that the cell chirality is not only sufficient but also required for the LR asymmetric morphology of the organ in *Drosophila* embryo.

We reanalyzed the relationship between the cell chirality and the laterality of the hindgut in the fixed embryos with various genotypes ([@fig:fig2]).
Our model fit for the fixed embryos also significantly fit for the living embryos ([@fig:fig3]C).
Therefore, the mechanism by which the cell chirality induces the LR asymmetry of the organ is determined regardless of genetic background.
We previously suggested that the cell chirality generates the LR asymmetric mechanical force, which rotates the hindgut LR asymmetrically [@Taniguchi2011; @Inaki2018].
*MyoID* is known as a key factor to form the stereotypic cell chirality [@Lebreton2018; @Taniguchi2011; @Sato2015].
We supposed that in wild-type, MyoID generates the normal cell chirality and almost all of the hindgut cells have the stereotypic cell chirality, which rotates the hindgut to the genetically determined direction.
Here we confirmed that the direction of the cell chirality in the living cells is same of that in the fixed wild-type cells ([@fig:fig3]B).
On the other hand, in the mutants that shows randomaized cell chirality such as *emc*, the rotational direction of the hindgut depends on the stochastically formed cell chirality, thus the LR asymmetry of the hindgut might be disrupted.

It has been studied well how organs are arranged asymmetrically, but little is known about how organs shape asymmetrical morphologies.
Although lots of studies suggested that the cell chirality regulates the asymmetrical morphogenesis of the organs, there were no conclusive evidence exists so far.
In this study, we elucidated the physiological role of the cell chirality and showed that it is essential for the left-right asymmetric morphogenesis of the hindgut.
To understand how the organs forms the stereotypic LR asymmetric shape, we should focus on the genetical mechanism inducing the normal cell chirality and the mechanical mechanism where the cell chirality generates the LR asymmetric force at the organ level.
