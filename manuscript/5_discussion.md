# Discussion

In previous studies, it was suggested that the enantiomorphic stats of cell chirality in the hindgut epithelium determine the directionality of the hindgut rotation.
Mainly, dextral and sinistral cell chirality on average lead to the counter-clockwise and clockwise rotation of the hindgut, respectively.
This postulation was firstly supported by the observations that the mean states of cell chirality and the LR directions of the hindgut rotation correlate to each other invarious mutants [@Taniguchi2011; @Ishibashi2019].
For example, in *MyoID* mutants where cell chirality become sinistral, their hindgut rorates clockwise, where wild-type embryos demonstrate dextral cell chirality and the counter-clockwise rotation of the hindgut [@Taniguchi2011].
Additionally, the cell chirality vanishes on average in *Drosophila E-cadherin* or *emc* mutants in which the LR-directions of hindgut rotation are randomized or the hindgut remains LR symmetric [@Taniguchi2011; @Ishibashi2019].
Secondary, computer simulation employing vertex models suggested that the enantiomorphic stats of cell chirality initially intdoruced into the model difines the LR direction of the model-gut tube rotation and successively drives the tube rotation to the direction determined at the outset [@Taniguchi2011].
Although these evidences consistenly suppot the postulation, the hypothesis has been grounded on the apparent concordance between the states of cell chirality and the LR directions of the hindgut rotation and on the prediction from computer simulations [@Taniguchi2011; @Inaki2018].
Thus, the cause and effect relationship between them needed to be verified.

To address this issue, here, we mathematically evaluated this hypotheical causal relationship by analyzing the correlation between the enantiomorphic stats of cell chirality and the LR direction of the hindgut rotation.
The means of the cell chirality index and laterality score in the fixed embryos were obtained for each of ten different genetic conditions, and correlation between them was analyzed.
In our logistic model, the mean cell chirality index representing each genotype as explanatory variable significantly fitted to the mean of the laterality score ([@fig:fig2]B).
Therefore, the mechanisms by which the cell chirality defines the LR-directionality of the hindgut rotation may be similar regardless of genetic backgrounds.
This result also demonstrates that the LR directionality of the hindgut rotation is statistically explained even only by the enantiomorphic stats of cell chirality as the average of embryos with each specific genotype.

In the correlation analysis of the fix embryos, the mean of cell chirlaity index was $0.01 \pm 0.02$ in *emc^AP6^* mutant embryos, nevertheless they showed the hindgut rotating to the directions of either clockwise or counter-clockwise or staying as bilaterally symmetric shape ([@fig:fig2]B) [@Ishibashi2019].
Thus, one can argue that cell chirality may not be essential for directing the hindgut rotation.
Our analyses here addressed this question.
In this study, we developed a method to determine the live cell chirality and the directions of the hindgut rotation in each of living embryo.
We found that the live cell chirality indexes representing each individual embryo of *emc^AP6^* mutant are varied widely among embryos and distributed from plus to minus values, although the mean value of the live cell chirality index of these embryos was nearly zero ([@fig:fig3]B).
Therefore, this mutant background was found useful to analyze the correlation between the states of cell chirality and the rotational directions of the hindgut in each live embryo.
Our logistic model formulated from the data of the live *emc^AP6^* mutant embryos showed significant correlation between the live cell chirality index and the laterality score of each indivual embryo ([@fig:fig3]C).
Therefore, in each of these embryos, the live cell chirality index significantly explained the rotational directions of the hindgut or its bilateral structure.
Based on these results, we ascertained that the cell chirality is not only sufficient but also required for the hindgut rotation, because our model predicts that living embryos with zero cell chirality index tend to have bilaterally symmetric hindgut.

Importantly, the logistic model obtained from the fixed embryos with various genetic conditions significantly fitted the data obtained from each living *emc^AP6^* mutant embryo
(Quasibinomial GLM, likelihood ratio test, $\chi^{2}_{1} = 4.327$, $p < 0.05$), and it explained 72.5% of the total variation in the rotational direction of *emc^AP6^* mutant hindgut ([@fig:fig3]C; [@tbl:tbl3]).
Given that individual embryos all carrying the same *emc^AP6^* mutant background showed a wide range of live cell chirality index, cell chirality may be formed stochastically in each individual under this condition.
Nevertheless, the logistic model formulated from the data of fixed embryos with various genotypes significantly explains the data that presumably reflects the stochastic events in each *emc^AP6^* individual.
Therefore, underlying mechanisms in which cell chirality drives the LR-directional rotation of the hindgut are common between the cell chirality formed by the modes determined genetically and stochastically.

In this study, we mathematically confirm the causal relationship between cell chirality and the hindgut rotation.
Our logistic model also implied that the cell chirality is sufficient and necessary for the hindgut rotation.
Considering the time course of the events in which cell chirality formation is precede the initiation of the LR-directional rotation of the hindgut *in vivo*, our presented results demonstrate that cell chirality is the primary cause of the hindgut rotation.
Since, cell chirality is involved in the LR-asymmetric development of various organs in *Drosophila*, such cause and effect relationship can be applicable to explain their morphogenesis.
Furthermore, our idea could be extended to the LR-asymmetric developments in other various species, which are known to involve the cell chirality.
