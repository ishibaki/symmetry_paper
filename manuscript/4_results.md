# Results

We previously showed that the chirality index strongly correlated to the ratio of the normal hindgut laterality in the *Drosophila* embryos with various genotype [@Ishibashi2019 Figure 6A].
To evaluate which the cell chirality contributes to the hindgut laterality, we mathematically reanalyzed our previous data.
We scored the rotational direction of the hindgut as a laterality score ([@fig:fig2]).
We fitted the logistic model with the chirality index as an explanatory valuable.
The chirality index significantly explained the hindgut laterality
(Quasibinomial generalized linear model (GLM), two-tailed t-test, $p < 0.001$; [@fig:fig2] B; [@tbl:tbl1]).
<!-- Intercept: t(8) = -4.042, p = 0.003723
Chirality Index: t(8) = -5.992, p = 0.000326 -->

To elucidate the relationship between the cell chirality and the LR asymmetric morphology of the hindgut, we analyzed the chirality index in the live cells (live cell chirality) of the hindgut before rotation ([@fig:fig3] A).
Wild-type cells had the left-tilted live cell chirality (chirality index $< 0$) as with fixed cells ([@fig:fig3] B).
If the cell chirality induced the hindgut rotation, one would expect that the hindgut with inverse cell chirality should rotate to the inverse side of the wild-type [@Taniguchi2011; @Inaki2018].
Thus, we analyzed the relationships between the direction of the hindgut rotation and the live cell chirality before the hindgut rotation in *emc* mutants which showed the randomization of the cell chirality [@Ishibashi2019].
Compared with wild-type, the live cell chirality was marginally significantly increased in the *emc^AP6^* mutants.
(Two-tailed t-test, $p = 0.069217$; [@fig:fig3] B).
After the live imaging, we cultured the embryos at 25 for 3 hours and evaluated the rotational direction of the hindgut.
In the *emc* mutants, the live cell chirality before the hindgut rotation significantly explained the rotational direction of the hindgut
(Quasibinomial GLM, two-tailed t-test, $p < 0.01$; [@fig:fig3] C; [@tbl:tbl2]).
Importantly, the logistic regression line of [@fig:fig2] significantly fit the data also of living embryos
(Quasibinomial GLM, likelihood ratio test, $\chi^{2}_{1} = 4.327$, $p < 0.05$),<!-- p = 0.0220359 -->
and it explained 72.5% of the total variation in the rotational direction of *emc* mutant hindgut ([@tbl:tbl3]).
