\(A) Rotation of the *Drosophila* embryonic hindgut (orange) visualized by *UAS-myr-GFP* (cell membrane) driven by *byn-Gal4*.
In the wild-type, the hindgut rotates counter-clockwise and it exhibits a rightward pointing hook shape.
\(B) Before rotation (orange), the apical boundaries of the wild-type hindgut epithelial cells tend to slant to the left, the normal cell chirality.
After rotation (gray), the cell chirality disappears.
\(C) Schematic summarizing the procedure used to calculate the chirality index.
The angle between each boundary and the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the hindgut is determined.
LR represents the left-right axis of the hindgut.
Each boundary is classified as a right-tilted boundary (orange) or left-tilted boundary (turquoise).
The numbers of right-tilted ($N_{R}$) and left-tilted ($N_{L}$) boundaries were counted, and the chirality index was calculated using the formula shown at the right side of the figure.
Scale bars of images in A are 0.25 $\mu$m.

\(A) Schematic showing criteria for the laterality score.
The hindgut that rotates counter-clockwise (upper) or clockwise (bottom) was scored as 1 or 0, respectively.
The hindgut that does not rotate (middle) was scored as 0.5.
\(B) Graph showing the correlation between cell chirality and the mean value of the laterality score.
The data in our previous paper [@Ishibashi2019] was used for this analysis.
The genotypes are shown in the right panel.
Dotted line indicates the logistic model that most fit for the data.
The coefficient of determination is shown as "$R^{2}$".
<!-- The *p*-value for the logistic model compared with the null model is shown. -->

\(A) Schematic showing the procedure for calculating the live chirality index and evaluation of the hindgut laterality.
The live image of the epithelial cell boundary visualized by *UAS-myr::GFP* driven by *byn-Gal4* is shown.
The chirality index of the live cell was calculated as described above.
After 3 hours of incubation, the laterality score was evaluated.
\(B) Box plot of the live chirality index of the hindgut in wild-type and *emc* mutant.
\(C) Graph showing the correlation between live cell chirality and the laterality score of the hindgut in *emc* mutant.
[Solid line indicates the best fitted logistic model]{.insertion author="Tomoki Ishibashi" date="2020-09-20T01:05:38Z"}.
Dotted line indicates the logistic model used in [@fig:fig2].
The coefficient of determination of each model is shown as "$R^{2}$".
"N" indicates the number of total embryos analyzed.
