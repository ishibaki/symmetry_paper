\(A) The *Drosophila* embryonic hindgut (orange) visualized by the expression of *UAS-myr-GFP*, encoding a cell-membrane marker, driven by *byn-Gal4*.
The hindgut has bilaterally symmetric structure whose anterior part curves ventrally at early stage 12.
In the wild-type, the hindgut subsequently rotates counter-clockwise and this rotation consequently makes this organ curved to the right side.
At the end of stage 13, the hindgut exhibits a rightward pointing hook shape.
"L" and "R" indicate left and right, respectively.
\(B) Before rotation (orange), the apical cell-boundaries of the wild-type hindgut epithelial cells tend to slant to the left, which is defined as the dextral cell chirality.
After rotation (gray), the cell chirality disappears so that these cells become LR symmetric.
\(C) Schematic summarizing the procedure used to calculate the cell chirality index.
The angle between each boundary and the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the hindgut is determined.
LR represents the left-right axis of the hindgut.
Each boundary is classified as a right-tilted boundary (orange) or left-tilted boundary (turquoise).
The numbers of right-tilted ($N_{R}$) and left-tilted ($N_{L}$) boundaries were counted, and the cell chirality index was calculated using the formula shown at the right side of the figure.
Scale bars in A are 0.25 $\mu$m.

\(A) Schematic showing criteria for the laterality score.
The hindgut that rotates counter-clockwise (upper) or clockwise (bottom) was scored as 1 or 0, respectively.
The hindgut that does not rotate (middle) was scored as 0.5.
\(B) Graph showing the correlation between cell chirality and the mean value of the laterality score.
The data in our previous paper [@Ishibashi2019] was used for this analysis.
The genotypes are shown in the right panel.
[$N_x$ and $N_y$ indicate the numbers of total embryos used for the analyses of the chirality index and the laterality score, respectively.
The mean values (circles) and standard errors (colored lines) are shown.]{.insertion author="Tomoki Ishibashi" date="2020-09-24T16:53:13Z"}
Dotted line indicates the logistic model that most fit for the data.
The coefficient of determination is shown as "$R^{2}$".
<!-- The *p*-value for the logistic model compared with the null model is shown. -->

\(A) Schematic showing the procedure for calculating the live chirality index and evaluation of the hindgut laterality.
The live image of the epithelial cell boundary visualized by *UAS-myr::GFP* driven by *byn-Gal4* is shown.
The chirality index of the live cell was calculated as described above.
After 3 hours of incubation, the laterality score was evaluated.
\(B) Box plot of the live chirality index of the hindgut in wild-type and *emc* mutant.
"$N$" indicates the number of total embryos analyzed.
\(C) Graph showing the correlation between live cell chirality and the laterality score of the hindgut in *emc* mutant.
Solid line indicates the best fitted logistic model.
Dotted line indicates the logistic model used in [@fig:fig2].
The coefficient of determination of each model is shown as "$R^{2}$".

"$N$" indicates the number of total embryos analyzed.
