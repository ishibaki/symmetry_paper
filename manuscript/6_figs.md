\(A) Rotation of the *Drosophila* embryonic hindgut (orange) visualized by *UAS-myr-GFP* (cell membrane) driven by *byn-Gal4*.
In the wild-type, the hindgut rotates counter-clockwise and it exhibits a rightward pointing hook shape.
\(B) Before rotation (orange), the apical boundaries of the wild-type hindgut epithelial cells tend to slant to the left, the normal cell chirality.
After rotation (gray), the cell chirality disappears.
\(C) Schematic summarizing the procedure used to calculate the chirality index.
The angle between each boundary and the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the hindgut is determined.
LR represents the left-right axis of the hindgut.
Each boundary is classified as a right-tilted boundary (orange) or left-tilted boundary (turquoise).
The numbers of right-tilted ($N_{R}$) and left-tilted ($NL_{L}$) boundaries were counted, and the chirality index was calculated using the formula shown at the right side of the figure.
Scale bars of images in A are 0.25 $\mu$m.
